Jolly's cheatsheet for building a SPA with AngularJS and Bootstrap in Node.js 

(You'll be seeing unusual accomplishment ...)

html base structure, css style, js logic and data handling, graphics in blender, traditional payflow and shipstation connect, blockchain payflow and supply chain tracking, robotic actuation, sensoring, blocked accounting, energy sensing and management, and more!


## Process Map

### Project brainstorm and wireframes in Lucid Chart
    In a brainstorm session, we focus our attention toward the problems at hand and the resources/skills within our controll that may be used to solve them. 
### Build a project in AngularJS and Bootstrap
    We use AngularJS and Bootstrap to build the wireframes into a single page application (SPA) prototype. 
  - #### html
    use html to build the base structure of the spa.
    index page is the main page, and the other pages are the navigation routes with differing style indicators and data binders.
  - #### css
    use css to style the html elements.
    use bootstrap to style the html elements.
    hook css styling to real time data binders.
  - #### js
    use angularjs to handle the logic of the application. create app module, route config, controllers, services, and directives.
    add scripts to the index page.

### full stack
  - #### node.js
    use nodejs and express to build the backend server.
  - #### mongodb or mysql
    use mongodb or mysql to store the data.
  - #### authentication
    use passport to authenticate users.
  - #### supply chain
    inventory dashboard to track supply chain.
  - #### payflow
    use paypal payflow to process payments.
  - #### shipstation
    use shipstation to process orders.
  - #### blockchain
    integrate supply chain, payflow, and authentication data to blockchain. 

### tests
  - #### unit tests
      use karma to run the unit tests.
      use jasmine to write the unit tests.
      use angular-mocks to mock the angular services.
  - #### jest

### hosting
  - #### hostsinger
        use hostsinger to host the application.
        use hostsinger to host the database.
        use hostsinger to host the email server.
  - #### github pages
        use github pages to host the application.
        use github actions to build and deploy the application.    

### git
    git commands to 'git' along.  ya 'git' it? hahaha o what a good eye dear.

### Specialty Projects
  - #### iOT
    - ##### Custom SmallBiz Store Front
    - ##### SmartHome
