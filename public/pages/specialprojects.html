        Storefront is connected to smarthome data feed. It uses the inventory and present contracts entered into as a reference for what to display to the public for purchase.
        Inventory is input by owner or by machine and displayed on the storefront for purchase.
        Purchases are deducted from the inventory and credits are added to the owner's wallet or smarthome purse.
        Inventory is rotated and owner is alerted of any inventory that needs urgent processing.
