    <h1>ðŸ“’ Decent Arch Ourstory Widget</h1>
    As records begin to pop up around the globe, oracles can connect the story from a decentralized data source and tell a more all-inclusive story.
    With every homestead having access to a distributed ledger and resource pool, the artifacts of our history will no longer have to wait for a centralized power to take interest.
    However simple and new, or complex and old, discoveries are annotated and placed into context by whomever has the missing piece(s).
