        <h3>Use Case Scenario</h3>
        <p>Smarthomes connect to each other to draft contracts and negotiate deals behind the scenes.  A smarthome owner reviews the suggestions and verifies the contracts would indeed be helpful.  The owner connects their wallet and grants permission to their local smarthome mesh to execute the contract as drafted, or to make changes and re-propose.  When all parties to the contract are satisfied with the deal, the contract executes and alerts the relevant parties of their necessary involvement as it is needed for legitamte exectuion of the entered agreement.</p>
        <p>So let's say my smarthome notices it's fiddlehead season here in NY and a nearby neighbor has a blockchained history of having offered that every year as a product on their smarthome menu because their smarthome is on some good marshey, swampy fiddlehead land.  My smaethome also notices that I like morel mushrooms - a product also known to be on this neighbor's menu.  My neighbor's smarthome notices I just started a coffee business and even though the price is slightly more than the folgers they normally buy, their smarthome preferences favor contracts with regard to proximity.</p>
        <p>Our smarthomes see a good match to enter into a 'smart contract' on our behalf.  They work out a set of terms and propose to us a discreet, unique, and mutually beneficial arrangment - say, 1lb of coffee for 1 lb of fiddleheads and one oz of morels.  My neighbor and I see the alert, have had success before with similar arrangments, and we both like this price point so we click ok and enter into the contract. </p>
        <p>What is perhaps so interesting about this scenario is the inherent ability to execute peer to peer, neighborly, grassroots micro financing.  Let's say I already agreed to this wonderful arrangement and in the coming days ... my roaster goes Kaput!  O no! I'm aleady locked in this contract. What do I do?</p>
        <p>A little bummed out by my new expense and life obstacle, I notify my smarthome, who notifies the contract (and therefore my neighbor).</p> 
        <p>A suggestion immediately pops up! One of my regular coffee customers, who has interest in the roaster being in good operation, also would like in on your neighbor's seasonal delicacy menu.  It turns out this coffee customer has a booth at the local farmersmarket selling candles and they just set their smarthome preferences to seek out local micro business oportunitites to help boost profits at the candle booth by offering a couple extra products for a commission. </p>
        <p>Almost immediately our smarthomes have drafted a contract that uses a small amount of sidelined capital from my coffee customer up front to send me a replacement part for my roaster and get me back in the game.  The coffee customer with the sidelined capital would rather have their coffee and really needs a third product to sell at their candle booth to gain enough commission to make it worth it. Having entered into a unique and discreet fiddlehead and morel contract of their own, they just need one more product and would really like to offer fresh roasted coffee. </p>
        <p>The neighbor with the fiddleheads and morels will have easy, cheap, and efficient access to the farmer's market without having to do any marketing and will also have a local trade for candles and coffee!</p>
        <p>And I will have the original deal my smarthome knew I would enjoy (coffee for fiddleheads and morels), another life story to tell at the barnyard shin-dig, and an unforeseen (possibly otherwise unknown if not for the opportunities noticed and contracts drafted by our smarthomes behind the scenes), mutually beneficial, well accounted for, responsible relationship centered around mutual values and the need for a small amount of capital to support a secure storage or transfer of value as they were in that series of discreet moments in social history.</p>

        <p>Seem complicated? That's the POINT!  Their are likely many complex relationships right under our noses that, once unpacked and understood, may prove to behoove us to know about!  By using modern social algorithms and a verifiable blockchain to better organize the complex web of social interaction centered around regular mundane value exchange executed daily by most households, we stand to capture back the monetary and cultural wealth of that data and equally distribute it to the peoples to whom it rightfully belongs simply by being more efficient stewards of it - or letting our smarthome processors be better allocators of energy than our representative governments or corporate overlords.  With much of the common mundane value exchanges out of the hands of elected officials and for-profit pyramid networks, they will have time for other more meanignful activies, there will likely need to be many more of them in yet another layer of organization, and they need not withdraw such hefty compensation for serving fewer people with better quality more easily.</p>
