        <h3>Use Case Scenario</h3>
        <p>Currently, for most of us, our lives are centered away from the home.  The oil, vehicle, and travel industries would love to keep it that way.  You're tired of hearing the 20th century adage about the lengthy trip your dinner journeyed before arriving to your plate and this injustice will be ignored and shrugged off for the last time.  Today, you and your household are going to do something about it!</p>
        <p>From photon to carbohydrate, a smarthome can help you realize a more efficient future. By centering your livelihood around your chosen shelter, you're sure to lighten the demand on oil, travel less vehicle miles, release less CO2, and live a healthier, cleaner life.  With all this attention to your homestead, it is likely that your home will appreciate in 'real' value as well!</p>
        <p>Firstly, energy input and output is measured and balanced according to a completely customizable algorithm.  As energy is collected from a local renewable source, the smarthome algorithm considers how to use the harvest to make your house more ... well ... livable.</p>
        <p>Secondly, your home's local environment is optimized for growth of natures best energy storage mechanism known to humans - edible plants and medicines. Batteries and other human manufactured electron storage mechanisms are really only good for a certain bandwidth and frequency range of energy storage and it's ususally quite deadly to humans.  Indeed, this bandwidth range is an important one to us humans and, since available, a necessary one to catalize a human-centered energy-oscillating storage circuit.  By optimizing your local environment for food growth, you will store energy in little nutritional packets called 'fruits, vegetables, and herbs'. Your batteries are edible!  Choose the ones you like and care for them with love! </p>
        <p>Thirdly, through a clever use of the input energy, energy storages are offered on a decentral public market and storefront.  Some of the smarthome energy goes to codifying your spot on the global market alongside all your other 8 billion neighbors.  If you stored too many fruits, you can trade them for vegetables. If you have too much 'cash' (electrons), you can trade them for vegetables, assets, or services, etc.  Since a smarthome is trying to limit CO2 release and oil dependency, local products are favored and grassroots handshakes replace old, invasive, and destructive mega shipping routes.</p>
        <p>Lastly, assets and produce stores are well accounted for on a public ledger.  This means everything is more likely to be more and more 'as they say it is' as everything is easily publicly verifiable in history.  Recorded assets and produce are by definition more realized.  Or to say it better, the global food supply will become more liquid as more smarthomes become beacons of energy storages available locally and on a global scale. Renewable assets will likely spawn more lucrative and liquid secondary markets, allowing for a more economically diverse population coming online in a reasonably sustainable and an efficient manor.   </p>
        <br>
        <p>By centering your life around your home, you guarantee a more equitable future for us all! Bless this mess! Make your home decent and smart and end your 'dis-ease' today!</p>

        <h3>Use Case Scenario</h3>
        <p>So you've heard that homes have started to become 'Smart'. And what's this 'Garden' we all live in?</p>
        <p>You want to dive in but you're not sure where to get started.  You don't have any land and you're not the one in the family 'who does the tech stuff'.</p>
        <p>Well good news! <br>
            There's a number of modern interfaces and microprocesses right at our finger tips that allow us to better manage our spaces and energy storages! <br>
            We're just going to start a process you can get interested in <br>
            in a space you do have available <br>
            and collect the data we need to make it most effecient for you and your surrounding community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A few great micro processes that can better your quality of life at home are 
            <ul>
                <li>microgreens</li>
                <li>mushrooms</li>
                <li>brews and ferments</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            With one of these chosen micro processes you can benefit from a smarthome algorithm!
            So even if you are in a small apartment,
            if you choose an output that is favorable to your lifestyle
             - the one you work so hard to maintain anyway 
            Then we feed the energy input (often heat, electricity, nutrients, and medium)
            and the output (harvest weight and recycled waste)
            through an algorithm designed to learn and optimize the process along with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            As your product becomes easily reproduced and propogated amongst your local loved ones (family and neighbors)
            the avenue for purchase at market is waiting and ready to exchange your product - made with your local preferences
            with someone else's product - made with their local prefences - without any intermediaries in between.
            <br>
            a unique promisary note,
            <br>
            for a unique purpose,
            <br>
            between two people who already would extend official shopping rights and transactional receipt to each other if it werent for all the formalities for such a small, passive, yet powerful energy transformation that you and your smarthome play with all the time.  Why? Because that's life.  Now you just have another good friend with you! A smarthome. An 'arduino'.
            <br>
            and it's connected to others so when you start your micro process, the algo will not only learn from you, it will draw from all the others around you and help you see where you are best situated on a global exchange!
            <br>
            How cool is that? It's not only smart ... it's futuristic and yet somehow timeless.<br>
            So how does it all happen?
            by connecting modern electronics used to manage the growth and transformations of various edibles to a processor more reliable than our own brains!
            As energy moves through the macro medium, we use some of what we've captured to ensure we always have a spark to get started again.
            We start with a space in our house that has the most natural range of control for the process we wish to perform
            Then we connect a light, or a heater and a fan, some water pumps ... whatever is necessary to allow for a naturally vigoruous and efficient growth of the product we're seeking.
            Then we brace for impact/takeoff as markets adjust to all the micro economies that 'crop' up right in our own households!
            Imagine not paying for %50 or more of your food bill AND having it right in your basement
            or growing a high value crop hard to get in your area and exchanging it on a decentralized open market for your <em>entire food bill</em> - without <em>having</em> to leave your house. <br>
            of course you could ... and everything would be growing just the same and waiting to be harvested when you return!

        <h3>Use Case Scenario</h3>
        <p>Smarthomes connect to each other to draft contracts and negotiate deals behind the scenes.  A smarthome owner reviews the suggestions and verifies the contracts would indeed be helpful.  The owner connects their wallet and grants permission to their local smarthome mesh to execute the contract as drafted, or to make changes and re-propose.  When all parties to the contract are satisfied with the deal, the contract executes and alerts the relevant parties of their necessary involvement as it is needed for legitamte exectuion of the entered agreement.</p>
        <p>So let's say my smarthome notices it's fiddlehead season here in NY and a nearby neighbor has a blockchained history of having offered that every year as a product on their smarthome menu because their smarthome is on some good marshey, swampy fiddlehead land.  My smarthome also notices that I like morel mushrooms - a product also known to be on this neighbor's menu.  My neighbor's smarthome notices I just started a coffee business and even though the price is slightly more than the folgers they normally buy, their smarthome preferences favor contracts with regard to proximity.</p>
        <p>Our smarthomes see a good match to enter into a 'smart contract' on our behalf.  They work out a set of terms and propose to us a discreet, unique, and mutually beneficial arrangment - say, 1lb of coffee for 1 lb of fiddleheads and one oz of morels.  My neighbor and I see the alert, have had success before with similar arrangments, and we both like this price point so we click ok and enter into the contract. </p>
        <p>What is perhaps so interesting about this scenario is the inherent ability to execute peer to peer, neighborly, grassroots micro financing.  Let's say I already agreed to this wonderful arrangement and in the coming days ... my roaster goes Kaput!  O no! I'm aleady locked in this contract. What do I do?</p>
        <p>A little bummed out by my new expense and life obstacle, I notify my smarthome, who notifies the contract (and therefore my neighbor).</p> 
        <p>A suggestion immediately pops up! One of my regular coffee customers, who has interest in the roaster being in good operation, also would like in on your neighbor's seasonal delicacy menu.  It turns out this coffee customer has a booth at the local farmersmarket selling candles and they just set their smarthome preferences to seek out local micro business oportunitites to help boost profits at the candle booth by offering a couple extra products for a commission. </p>
        <p>Almost immediately our smarthomes have drafted a contract that uses a small amount of sidelined capital from my coffee customer up front to send me a replacement part for my roaster and get me back in the game.  The coffee customer with the sidelined capital would rather have their coffee and really needs a third product to sell at their candle booth to gain enough commission to make it worth it. Having entered into a unique and discreet fiddlehead and morel contract of their own, they just need one more product and would really like to offer fresh roasted coffee. </p>
        <p>The neighbor with the fiddleheads and morels will have easy, cheap, and efficient access to the farmer's market without having to do any marketing and will also have a local trade for candles and coffee!</p>
        <p>And I will have the original deal my smarthome knew I would enjoy (coffee for fiddleheads and morels), another life story to tell at the barnyard shin-dig, and an unforeseen (possibly otherwise unknown if not for the opportunities noticed and contracts drafted by our smarthomes behind the scenes), mutually beneficial, well accounted for, responsible relationship centered around mutual values and the need for a small amount of capital to support a secure storage or transfer of value as they were in that series of discreet moments in social history.</p>

        <p>Seem complicated? That's the POINT!  Their are likely many complex relationships right under our noses that, once unpacked and understood, may prove to behoove us to know about!  By using modern social algorithms and a verifiable blockchain to better organize the complex web of social interaction centered around regular mundane value exchange executed daily by most households, we stand to capture back the monetary and cultural wealth of that data and equally distribute it to the peoples to whom it rightfully belongs simply by being more efficient stewards of it - or letting our smarthome processors be better allocators of energy than our representative governments or corporate overlords.  With much of the common mundane value exchanges out of the hands of elected officials and for-profit pyramid networks, they will have time for other more meaningful activies, there will likely need to be many more of them in yet another layer of organization, and they need not withdraw such hefty compensation for serving fewer people with better quality more easily.</p>
